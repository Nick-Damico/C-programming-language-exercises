 *  Exercise:  2-5
 * 
 *  Objective:  Write the function any(s1,s2), which returns the first location in the string s1
 *              where any character from the string s2 occurs, or -1 if s1 contains no characters from s2.
 *              (The standard library function strpbrk does the same job but return a pointer to the location.)

 *  Solution: 
 *      
 *  Notes:
